## Wireframe still in progress 
### Search - Wireframe still in progress
1. Search box: dynamic sizing, behaviors presented as separate divs with and "X" link that can be clicked to remove a behvior from the search box
2. Behaviors: links for behaviors, categorized by alphabet, clicking on link will add the behavior to the search box
   Note: future implementation would include option to add custom behaviors 
3. "Public" checkbox: checking this box would enable 2 textboxes "School Name" and "School Zip" for the user to enter which will be collected in the backend for research purposes; unchecked box keeps it private 
4. Submit button
### Results - WireFrame still in progress
1. 4 div filled in with a color (fill-in percentage depending upon correlation value), each div for each violence term to represent correlation of behavior terms to each violence term
    - each div is clickable, clicking it enables a small pop-up with information on that violence term; pop-up contains a "X" button to       close each dive and a button linking to the related intervention page 
2. Back button - link to the search page 
3. Buttons at the bottom of the page to share with teacher/principal, each button directly sends the info to the respective individual, can be made to enable a pop-up to provide more customized sharing expierience for future implementation 
4. Link to open a pop-up to view the respective behavior terms 

## Need to Start 
### Sign-Up Page
